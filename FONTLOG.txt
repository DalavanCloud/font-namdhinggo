========================

This file provides detailed information on the Namdhinggo SIL font. This
information should be distributed along with the Namdhinggo SIL font and
any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

The Limbu, or Kirat Sirijonga, script is used by around 400,000 people in Nepal.

The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font

literacy and materials development work in the Limbu language.
